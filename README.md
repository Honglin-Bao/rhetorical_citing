# The Substantive Impact of Rhetorical Citations in Science

Honglin Bao (Harvard Business School hbao@hbs.edu) and Misha Teplitskiy (University of Michigan tepl@umich.edu)

This is the GitHub repository for our preprint "Do "bad" citations have "good" effects?" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06190)
Note the preprint has been revised for final publication.

We have implemented 6 models:

*   The full model with heterogeneous readers (base model, model 1.1)
*   The null model with heterogeneous readers, threshold-fixed (model 1.2)
*   The null model with heterogeneous readers, citing-budget-fixed (model 1.3)
*   The full model with homogeneous readers (model 2.1)
*   The null model with homogeneous readers, threshold-fixed (model 2.2)
*   The null model with homogeneous readers, citing-budget-fixed (model 2.3)

In this repository, we provided a comprehensively detailed commentary on the base model (model 1.1). For the other five models which are derived from the base model, we highlight the distinctions that differentiate them from model 1.1.
